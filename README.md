# Arrays1
------- 
*Your code should be written in the ./src/main/java/Assignment.java file.
*There are 10 questions, each with a method for you to implement.
*You may only used while loops to solve each of the problems.
*Your code will be auto tested.

Directions:
THE USE OF ARRAYLISTS (or any other collection)IS OFF LIMITS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.
Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.

Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.

In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. 
Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will
not receive full credit.
